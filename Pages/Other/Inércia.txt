In the very begginging of any science, the truth is the main if not the only objective. But in order to grow science must rely on 
people's money, time and resources. And then we get instituions that maintain science and its evolution. But now 
you have values that have almost nothing to do with the truth. The instituions that were raised around science will
almost naturaly resist to any change that have the potencial to compromise its existence. And the fact is that
any change, any new idea has the potencial to compromise these institutions. I we look againd to the beggining we can
see that is not that science corrupts it self. What realy happens is that since the begging science, as the search for the
truth, for the facts, was not alone in the world. Since the very begging there are interests and things that come into play that have
no mandotory commitment to the truth. 

This resistance to change is almost a common mechanism in every system in evolution. 
Starting from nothing, a science is free to choose and try every possible path.
But after sometime following any path, it starts to build a resistance to switch to 
other paths, because there's now a entire world relying on this path.
This is true for good and for worse. It's good because resistence to new ways
is important to preserve the achivements and ideias already proved to be good.
Conversely it is bad because also protect bad ideias and practices.
